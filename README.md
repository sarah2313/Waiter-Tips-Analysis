# Waiter Tips Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the factors influencing waiter tips using data analysis and machine learning. By analyzing features such as total bill, time of day, customer demographics, and dining habits, we aim to build a predictive model for tip amounts.

## Dataset
We use the "tips" dataset, which contains information on waiter tips based on different variables like gender, smoking status, and meal size.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy plotly scikit-learn
```

## Usage
Run the notebook to explore the dataset, visualize trends, and train the prediction model:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv("tips.csv")
print(data.head())
```

## Key Findings
- Certain factors, like total bill and dining time, strongly influence tipping behavior.
- Visualizing data helps uncover tipping trends.
- A machine learning model can predict tips with reasonable accuracy.

## Results
- Data analysis revealed patterns in customer tipping behavior.
- A regression model was trained to predict tips based on restaurant bill and other features.

## Future Improvements
- Collecting more real-world data to improve model accuracy.
- Incorporating additional features like service rating.
